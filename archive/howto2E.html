You can manage to control the car even keeping the speed maximum, but
as soon as you lose concentration, you'll get course out. You should step off the gas a little 
before you go into the corner. <br>
To prepare for the next jump, turn the nose to the inside, and 
jump straight to make the posture stable.<br>

<td><font size=+2><b><a name="c2">second corner(right)</a></b></font><p>

The car will inevitably come to the side, but if you try to go into the inside
the rear tire will slide. <br>
If you steer little by little and do out-middle-out cornering, you 
could keep the rev of the engine.After you get out of the corner, , you should run the right 
side of the road.<br>

<td><font size=+2><b><a name="c3">third corner(left)</a></b></font><p>

If you are in maximum speed and try to go into the inside, the rear tire will spin. <br>
Again in 
this corner, you should try to go from middle to out. If you want to go into the inside, you 
should step off the gas first. <br>
In either way, you should avoid sudden steering, and steer little 
by little.<br>

        Enter from outside and make a slight right turn by delicatly reducing
        the speed. When you reach the inside of the curve with a space of about
        one car between the curve and your vechecle, step on the gas and
        expand toward the outside of the track. In case of full acell, it is
        easy to trace the rut.<br>

<td><font size=+2><b><a name="c5">(final)fifth corner (right)</a></b></font><p>

        Cut the steering ahead of time, and if you reach the inside, with a
        full accelaration run through. If you are sure that you could make the
        turn place the steering to netural position. If the timing is good
        you could run through this curve with full speed.<br>
