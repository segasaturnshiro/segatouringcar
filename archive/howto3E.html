        Enter from out into inside with acute angle. Keep that angle
        and drift toward outside.<br>
        If the timing of cutting toward inside is too slow you might
        crash so in that case, drop your gear down to fifth mission.<br>

        Be cautious, when exiting the curve rather than entering the
        curve. Try to feel like cutting the steer toward the oppsite side
        moment before exiting the curve.(In this case, to the left) Or else,
        the machine will go crazy. Another way is to cut the steering bit
        by bit and adjust your direction.<br>

        To prepare for the next corner, enter the curve from outside
        and by decreaing your acceleration try not to expand your orbit.<br>
        In case your orbit is too much to the outside, it is difficult to
        turn the next corner. If you are put emphasis on safty maybe
        dropping gear to fifth is a bright idea.<br>

<td><font size=+2><b><a name="c4">fourth corner (left)</a></b></font><p>

        
        Drop the gear down to fifth mission and clear the curve by
        cutting widly. You could drift but beaware of the timing.<br>
        If the timing of cutting the steer is too slow you might
        crash into the wall, so in case you felt danger loosen your
        accelertion.<br>

<td><font size=+2><b><a name="c5">fifth corner (right)</a></b></font><p>


        You can easily turn the curve when you are in the fifth mission.<br>
        When in the sixth mission, decrease your speed for a moment and than
        accelerate again after the curve. If shift change is too early,
        you will drift toward outside, by the over power so beaware.<br>
        So in that case, step off the gas and maintain a certain engine revs.

<td><a href="#map"><img src="jpg/c2-6.jpg" alt="image" width=140 height=96 border=0></a></td>
<td><font size=+2><b><a name="c6">(final)sixth corner (right)</a></b></font><p>


        Take the out-middle-out course, with gear on the forth transmission.
        If you cut toward the inside too much, engine rev will drop radically
        so keep the engine rev on the red zone and maintain the accel and
        the angle that you have at that time. Step fully on the gas pedal
        and weak on the brake is one technique to conqure this corner.<br>
        If you felt confident that you can turn the curve shift up fifth to
        sixth gear.<br>
