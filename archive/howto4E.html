        Right after the start accelerate until you reach the maximum speed.<br>
        Next consecutive curves are are waiting for you. Curves are lenient
        so drive as if you are driving straight road. after the last curve
        place your machine to the left side of the track. If you see the
        first corner drop the gear to forth and at the same time cut the
        steering radically. When the nose of the vechecle touch the inside
        of the track shift up to fifth gear.<br>

        Enter from outside of the track with 45 degree angle also droping
        gear down to fourth. If it goes well you could run through the curve
        with a  beautiful arc. In case you did not enter the corner from
        inside there is a high possibility of crash so loosen your accel.<br>
        After exiting the curve, accelerate to maximum speed and run on the
        left hand side of the road.<br>

<td><font size=+2><b><a name="c3">third corner (right)</a></b></font><p>


        When you run through two third of the straight part of the course,
        drop the gear down to fourth and take a intense right turn. If you
        get on the grass you do not have to decrease your speed that much
        but if not you have to decrease to half the speed. If you recover
        and return to the grass, speed up so that you can aim for the best
        lap.<br>
</td><tr>

<td><font size=+2><b><a name="c4">fourth corner (left)</a></b></font><p>


        Enter from the middle to inside, with a fifth gear tracking the grass
        part of the track. Ideal is to recover and exiting from the middle.<br>
        (middle-in-middle) It is difficult to prepare for the next corner with
        full power, so beaware of it.<br>
</td><tr>


<td><a href="#map"><img src="jpg/c3-5.jpg" alt="image" width=140 height=96 border=0></a></td>
<td><font size=+2><b><a name="c5">fifth corner (right)</a></b></font><p>


        Drop the gear down to forth before entering the curve, and run inside
        of the track through out the corner. If you are on the grass, you do
        not have to let go the accel. Toward the end of the curve and you are
        still on the grass set transmission up to fifth and run though.<br>
</td><tr>


<td><a href="#map"><img src="jpg/c3-6.jpg" alt="image" width=140 height=96 border=0></a></td>
<td><font size=+2><b><a name="c6">sixth corner (left)</a></b></font><p>


        If you attack from the outside of the track cut the steering ahead of
        time and by drifting cut into the inside of the track. From middle,
        let go your accel for a bit and get on the grass and cut into inside.<br>
        Neither way, you could run through the curve with fifth gear.<br>
</td><tr>


<td><a href="#map"><img src="jpg/c3-7.jpg" alt="image" width=140 height=96 border=0></a></td>
<td><font size=+2><b><a name="c7">(final)seventh corner (right)</a></b></font><p>


        When you run through two third of the straight part of the course,
        drop the gear all the way down to second by using brake. Than take
        a wide turn with half accel.<br>
        Ideal is to attack from middle to inside but if you attack from
        outside, you could still manage to turn the curve with a slight drift.<br>
        If the nose did not turn toward inside, step on the brake slightly.<br>
