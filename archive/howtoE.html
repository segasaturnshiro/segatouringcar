<a name="car"><font size=+3><b>Differnce of performance between car model</b></font></a><p>

    The performance of driving varies amoung car model, so you have to change your mind when 
using 4WDcar and FRcar.<br>
      4WD car has a stable steering, and has high coordinating point at the corner, so it is 
easy to use for beginners.<br>
     FR car transmit all of the power to the road surface from the rear tire,
so sudden steering will cause power slide, and if you don't make a counter steer, you will lose 
the control. You will need delicate seering and balance control, but it is more powerfull than 
4WD car, so the expert who want to drive aggressively may want to chose this type.
<br>
The driving force type of the four cars are these:
<br><br>


<font size=+0>4WD : AlphaRomeo/Opel<br>
FR  : Mercedes/Toyota</font>
<br><br>
      
     By the way, we adjusted so that there is no advantage/disadvantage on time between the 
driving force type. Instead, we want everyone to actually play and give a conclusion to the 
discussion "Which is faster".<br>


<br><br>

<a name="basic"><font size=+3><b>The basic ways to run</b></font></a><p>


    In the actual touring car race, if you slide the tire, the engine will rev down, and will 
lead to the timeloss. Therefore, driver has to bear in mind not to slide the tire by appropriate 
breaking and shift change.<br>
    This game also reproduce the sense of grip driving, and we want you to enjoy the driving in 
the limit of the machine.<br>
    To change your mind from the old racing games using drift driving, we want to explain few 
points.<br><br>

      
<font size=+2><b>Slow in - Fast out</b></font><br>
          If you try to control the speed after you came to the limit of cornering, the action 
will be instable, and the acceleration will be slow. So in the
acute curve,you should slow down before you enter the curve, go into the inside, then step on 
the gas. It's OK if you catch the feeling to accelerate when you get out of the curve.
<br><br>
      

<font size=+2><b>Weight balance</b></font><br>

          The driving ability of cars in this game are based on numbers of parameter. Therefore, 
the curving condition will change evey minute according to the weight balance of front and back. 
If you step off the gas or step on the brake and increase the weight on the front, the grip on 
front tire will increase and the steering will be sharper. On the other hand , if you step on 
gas suddenly, the grip of front tire will decrease, becomes understeer, and will be likely to 
get out of the course. This also shows the importance of slow in-fast out.
<br><br>


<font size=+2><b>Out-In-Out</b></font><br>
  
          As explained above, if you take an overbearing course, not only that engine rev will 
decrease , but tail slide may occur. In this game also, it is important to keep the grip and try 
not to decrease the rev of the engine by taking a lenient course. These delicate caputurebility 
is probably very rare in the games now days.
<br><br>


<font size=+2><b>Avoid sudden steering</b></font><br>
     
         Since the field of vision in the display is small in the game, so usually, you have 
more speed than you think. Therefore, sudden steering will cause tail slides. When you go into 
the corner, you should deciede how much you will steer the handle beforehand, and after that, 
you should make the little sdjustment by accel work.
<br><br>


<font size=+2><b>The way of driving for differnt driving force</b></font><br>
    
         To drive a 4WD car, you just need to know the points above, but you need a little more 
for the FR car. Basicly it is faster not to drift, but FR has a power to compensate the decrease 
of engine rev, so there are times that it will be faster to drift a little. However, you have to 
becareful so you don't keep on steering until the tail slides. It is just good to drift 
smoothly, but it will still be slow to slide the tail. Also, when driving FR car, it may be 
better to steer the handle a little bit faster than 4WD car. Anyway, if you respond quikly from 
the reaction from the road, you will probably be able to maintain the control.
