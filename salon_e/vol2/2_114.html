  I can't help you with much concerning the arcade version. Consider yourself a lucky person for seeing it in action. The sight of the thing compared to my saturn might cause too much emotional stress. <br>
  Two lap championship mode is very simple. Like the regular championship your game starts with a qualifying lap and then the race spans across all three of the courses (Beginer, Medium, Expert, I don't know about the extra course. It might a saturn only course.) Now all you have to do is run the 2 laps in the required amount of time on each course. After that the time from all your laps (excluding qualifying lap) are added up giving you a total time. Being an arcade machine the amount of laps in championship mode are the set at the arcade owners descretion. I am assuming that your machine is set somewhere from 3 to 5 laps a course. That would explain you difference in times compared to the ranking area.    <br>
