Well, I had my first chance to play this game a few days ago. It's<br>
brand new here in Hungary, and it requires a fat purse to practise.<br>
However, I played a few, and after about 8 attempts I managed to cross<br>
the 4th finish line in the last second. It was something like 4:23...<br>
But let's talk about Touring cars.<br>
How on Earth are you able to go that fast with that Mercedes? Are you <br>
cheating in some way, or the machines are in easy mode?<br>
I drive the Toyota, but my personal best is a loosy 2:45'7, and that <br>
seems to be excellent in Budapest, where 2 million people would have <br>
the chance to improve this time.<br>
So, please, let me now about the details.
