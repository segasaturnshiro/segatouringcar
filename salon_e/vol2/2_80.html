If you are a Japanese (or anywhere in Asia) gamer who can read Japanese and enjoy Sega's games and gaming in general, Dimension S: Saturn and Beyond (www.dimension-s.com) is looking for YOU. We need someone to help us get the inside info on what is coming out in Japan and with game reviews. All you'd be required to do is surf Japanese gaming sites and find news, as well as do game reviews of new games. We do have contacts with Sega and can probably arrange REVIEW COPIES of games for you if you can help us out. Check out our site, we are one of the only Saturn sites left and want to be first with news of the Katana/or whatever Sega is calling it today. <br>
<br>
If interested, email me at the posted email address.<br>

Thanks,<br>
