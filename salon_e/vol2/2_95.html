MAG! hey my friend!<br>
<br>
Mi ujsag?  MAG!! Nem is tudom, mit mondjak!<br>
 <br>
Happy to write to you again..<br>
You know, here in Quebec we are still waiting for SRC2, and I bet<br>
we won't even get it, as it happened with STCC..<br>
I'm still playing the old SRC1, but curiously I still have some fun..<br>
<br>
I play on "Practice" mode to make a change.. ahah!<br>
 Mountain---> 2:14'24 man!  But I don't mind how you can set 2:43'33<br>
 on Desert, how the fuck?? I only set in the 2:44 mark..<br>
 Forest--> 2:29'38, poor.<br>
<br>
Hey man, believe me or not, Japanese can set 3:14'xx with the normal<br>
car!!! And with the cheat it's 3:12'xx... Unbelievable..<br>
But I heard about a special technic called "Wall Turn" and "CompCar<br>
Turn" (Computer Car Turning technic..) <br>
<br>
1- "Wall turn":  You have to use it in hairpins on both Forest and <br>
   Mountain.  The main idea is to hit the outside wall, this will<br>
   give the car a speed boost. But it's hard to say if you gotta<br>
   hit the wall while in 4th gear, full speeding, braking and 1st gear,..<br>
   I don't know! And they manage to set 3:14 and 3:12!!! <br>
   Just incredible, I'll to see it with my own eyes to believe a<br>
   f*ckin word of what they say.. lol! :))<br>
<br>
2- "CompCar turn":  It's hitting the front side of a computer car,<br>
   it's good to use it while on the last right bend on Desert, as well<br>
   as on Mountain (the 1st-placed car, as soon as you reach it).<br>
<br>
But don't ask me how to do it, maybe I would have had to start<br>
practicing it when I first began to play on early 1995.. Now my<br>
possible best is 3:17'82 (Normal DELTA car) and 3:14'76 (Cheat car)<br>
and I don't even mind reaching these marks, 'cause SRC2 will arrive<br>
soon, I hope!!<br>
<br>
  Write back MAG!<br>
<br>
